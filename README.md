# tlsconfig

> build tls configurations

## about

Pivotal has internal requirements and guidelines as to the TLS configurations
we'd like to use for our internal services. This library stays up to date with
those internal requirements so that services just need to link against this.

This repository also includes a sub-package called `certtest` which can be used
to build valid PKIs for test.

## usage

See [GoDoc][godoc].
